# AnonyLink

## Description
AnonyLink is a script designed to enhance anonymity by changing and permanently monitoring the user's MAC address. It also resets all network connections and prompts the user to change the hostname. If AnonSurf is installed, AnonyLink will check and manage its status to ensure complete anonymity.

## Features
- Changes and monitors the MAC address to prevent tracking.
- Resets and disables all network interfaces before reconnecting.
- Prompts the user to change the hostname for added anonymity.
- Controls AnonSurf (if installed) to ensure it is properly configured.
